### Assignment 1 (Team Project)

#### Client-Server socket programming

The aim of this assignment was to implement two client-server (BSD socket library) network utilities in Python. Each utility requires different functionality:

* Client-Server 1: Client connects using TCP and sends its name to the server,the server validates the data input and echoes it back to the client.

* Client-Server 2: This utility includes a client that inputs up to 4 numbers interactively and a server then returns true/false if they are, or are not, powers of two.
